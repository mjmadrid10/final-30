Diary


Week 1:

We started thinking about what we wanted to do and spent all day trying to come up with ideas.
We decided to build a BB8 droid and started looking into the materials needed for it.
We then started making a blueprint and materials for the droid.
We started looking at how to assemble it only to figure out we wouldn’t be able to finish the project in time.
We started looking for ideas about what else we could do.

Week 2:

We kept on looking for ideas and when we decided to make a clap switch and a remote, we figured out that using a UBMP4 wasn’t gonna save us a lot of time, so we switched to arduino.
We ordered the materials needed for the clap switch and Millen started working on the code for the clap switch. Meanwhile, I was trying to figure out how to code the remote control. 
We started looking into the project to consist of colour changing lights, so we started using neopixels(disclaimer, they were crappy). Millen started soldering but very quickly came to figure out how hard it is to solder them.
Still nothing on the remote so we went for an LCD game but even with the correct wirings, the LCD wouldn’t turn on so we looked into what went wrong. Nothing.
We asked Mr. Lam what may be happening and we decided to switch the LCD for a new one then it started working. We looked into what the codes looked like for this and given how much time we had, we wouldn’t have finished. We copied the code and figured out it worked.

Week 3:
 
Millen took it home because she wanted to see how the code worked and it started out great but the LCD decided to go all evil on me and stopped working. 
Then Millen took it back to school and it started working. She went back to understanding why the code worked the way it did. 
After exams, Millen took both projects home ONLY to find out that the LCD stopped working again. 
We talked through what else we could do for the spare arduino we had and we decided with the materials we had, we would make a traffic light. Since I had experience with this kind of project I helped out and we got it done the night before demo day.
Then the mic on my clap sensor broke, so we no longer had a clap sensor.

Week 4:

Millen went to school early today to ask Mr.Lam to help fix the mic on the clap sensor in which shei fixed it by soldering wire onto the parts that were broken and attached it to the mic and it worked
We presented a demo of our project to the class and learnt that the analog pin was controlled with the arduino
